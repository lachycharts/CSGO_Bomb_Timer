# CSGO_Bomb_Timer
A CS:GO tool that displays bomb timer, round state and can provide sound cues to inform the player of the bomb's timing.

*Designed to display on your second monitor to display the bomb timer and round state.

*Use built-in or imported sounds at specified times to let you know exactly how long you've got left to defuse (for those without an extra monitor).

*Colour coded progress bar that can take up the whole second monitor lets you know what's happening in your periphery.

*Easily create a gamestate integration config file in your csgo/cfg directory.

*Saves your settings so you never have to touch them again.

If you've got ideas to improve it, let me know :)
